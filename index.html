            <h2>Technological Impact on Performing Arts</h2>
            <p>AI and emerging technologies are revolutionizing the performing arts by assisting in choreography, analyzing motion patterns, and providing real-time feedback. Totentanz (T3) exemplifies this transformation by protecting artists' creative works while enhancing performance analytics and audience engagement.</p>
            <p>Through cross-disciplinary collaborations, projects like T3 are creating rich, multi-disciplinary works that integrate dancers, musicians, and technologists to push the boundaries of artistic expression.</p>
            <p>The history of the performing arts is intertwined with technological advancements. From theater design, lighting, rigging, and sound to the integration of digital processes on stage, these innovations continually provide artists with new forms of expression and audiences with new forms of experience.</p>
            <p>COVID-19 accelerated the role of digital technology in the arts, leading to creative reconceptions of performances and audience engagement. The Doris Duke Foundation aims to support sustainable and effective use of digital technology in performing arts where it is artistically beneficial and creatively productive.</p>

                    <p>Totentanz, also known as T3, is a new use of pose estimation and facial recognition technologies to decrease AI theft and training that occurs without choreographer and dancer consent. This innovative solution aims to increase ownership and creative agency of artists.</p>

                <div class="grid-item">
                    <h3>Our Team and Sponsorship</h3>
                    <p>This solution was devised by <strong>Pedram Nimreezi</strong>, an AI engineer, and <strong>Nicole Perry</strong>, a dance and theatre artist. <strong>Momentum Stage</strong> is sponsoring the project, and it is funded through the inaugural “Performing Arts and Technologies Lab” grant from the Doris Duke Charitable Foundation.</p>

            <h2>Land Acknowledgment</h2>
            <p>Our Land Acknowledgment is a living document. This version was written in July 2021.</p>
            <p>Momentum Stage is based in Broward County, Florida, which is the occupied land of the ancestral stewards of the land—the Tequesta and Taino—as well as the current home to the Miccosukee Tribe of Indians of Florida, and the Seminole Tribe of Florida. Despite occupation and displacement, the Seminole and Miccosukee peoples still live, work, and create in South Florida, while maintaining their culture, traditions, and sovereignty. Momentum Stage is located in the United States, all of which is stolen land, built up by stolen people.</p>
            <p>We also want to recognize that we are coming to you via technology, a luxury. This technology is made possible by the natural resources of our environment and contributes to the environmental crisis we are living in. In our South Florida home, this looks like sea-level rise and threats to the Everglades.</p>
            <p>Additionally, this technology has a consumption cost that often limits participation to people with a certain level of income.</p>
            <p>As educators and creators, we know that there is value in embodied ways of knowing and taking action. We invite you to learn more about the Indigenous peoples on whose land you reside and create and the erased narratives of People of Color throughout history. We encourage you to take action to support causes important to your local Indigenous people and to bring these conversations to your students and your artwork in creative ways.
