                <h3>Doris Duke Foundation Announces Grants to 20 Innovative Projects</h3>
                <p><strong>September 25, 2024</strong></p>
                <p>The Doris Duke Foundation announced grants through its inaugural Performing Arts Technologies Lab, supporting 20 pioneering artists, technologists, and arts organizations. These grants aim to develop new uses for digital technologies across the performing arts.</p>
                <p><em>"Today is an important milestone for the Doris Duke Foundation as we proudly recognize these remarkable artists and organizations who have looked beyond their own challenges in search of solutions to meet the needs of an entire industry,"</em> said Sam Gill, president and CEO of the Doris Duke Foundation.</p>
                <p>The selected projects tackle a wide range of opportunities in how the performing arts are produced, distributed, and consumed, including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Exploring the use of emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence in creating, presenting, experiencing, and preserving works across the performing arts, particularly among artists representing underserved populations and cultures.</li>
                    <li>Enabling artists and audience members with disabilities to further access, create, and engage with art through the development of new digital tools.</li>
                    <li>Preserving inherently ephemeral works in the performing arts through new archiving technologies, fulfilling a need that is especially acute for Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) artists.</li>
                    <li>Pursuing field-wide solutions to pressing issues such as capital needs.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><em>"The more than 700 applications we received for this program sent us a clear message: performing artists are ready and excited to push the boundaries of what technology can do. They are asking critical questions about open-source approaches, accessibility, and representation. Our goal is to help these innovators do what artists do best—bringing new, powerful experiences to audiences."</em> — Ashley Ferro-Murray, Doris Duke Foundation Arts Program Director.</p>
